# KNN-on-PIMA
Applying KNN classifier in order to explores the prevelance of diabetes in a native american tribe
The provided code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for the analysis of the PIMA dataset. The code starts by loading the dataset, separating the features and labels, normalizing the features using min-max scaling, and then proceeds to split the data into training and testing sets. The KNN classifier is implemented by methods for fitting the model and making predictions. The code utilizes a range of K values to find the optimal K that results in the highest accuracy on the testing set. The accuracy scores for different K values are calculated, and the optimal K value is determined. Additionally, the code includes visualizations of the dataset, such as histograms of each feature and scatter plots of feature pairs. These visualizations provide insights into the distribution and relationships of the dataset features. Furthermore, the performance of the KNN classifier using different distance metrics, including Manhattan, Minkowski, and Euclidean has been explored. 
In conclusion, the code demonstrates the application of the KNN algorithm, evaluation of its performance with various K values and distance metrics, and provides visualizations which is really useful in order to aid in the analysis of the dataset.
